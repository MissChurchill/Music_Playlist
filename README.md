# music_playlist
This is my capstone project submitted after participating in the data analysis course 1 through Code Louisville. 

The purpose of the capstone project is to reinforce what was learned and show off my skills. This project shows off my new skills to potential employers and demonstrates my knowledge of Python, it’s methods and implementation. The project requirements include implementing a simple data analysis by reading data, performing calculations on the data, and displaying the results.

Packages that need to be installed to run the project include:

The 3 features included in my project based on the requirements include:
1. Python Programming Basics: Implements a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.	
2. Utilize External Data: Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app. In this application we use the following API source: https://itunes.apple.com which does not require a key to access.
3.  Data Display: Display data in tabular form.

The goal of the application is to allow users to create a music playlist and get information about songs that they enter.
